    <h1>Vibibi</h1>
    <img src="..\images\vibibi.png" alt="vibibi pancakes with fresh fruit">
    <p>Hundreds of years ago, people from other countries arrived to trade along Kenya's Indian Ocean coast. In cities like Mombasa, Arab and Indian influences blend with African traditions - like the spice blends into these yummy <em>coconut rice pancakes</em>! In Swahili <em>vibibi</em> means more than one of these pancakes. Just one of them is called a <em>kibibil</em>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups rice flour</li>
        <li>A pinch of cardamom</li>
        <li>2 tbsp coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the yeast, water, and a pinch of the sugar. Let it stand for about 5 minutes. The mixture will start to foam!</li>
            <li>In a big bowl, mix the sugar rice, flour, and cardamom.  Then add the coconut milk and yeast mixture. Stir well. The batter should be pourable, like pancake batter. If it's too thick, add a little water.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a towel and leave it alone for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a pan on medium heat. Pour roughly 1/4 cup of batter in the pan and spread to form a small pancake.</li>
            <li>When bubble start to form, flip the pancake to cook the other side.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 4-5 to cook the rest of the batter. Be sure to heat a little more oil on the pan before pouring each pancake. Serve with fresh fruit and yogurt.</li>
        </ol>
