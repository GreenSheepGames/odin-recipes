    <img src="..\images\onigiri.jpg" alt="prepared onigiri shaped like cute bears">
    <p>Onigiri are yummy <em>stuffed rice balls</em>. In Japan, some kids get decorated onigiri in their lunchtime bento boxes that are almost too cute to eat! Centuries ago, the warriors called samurai carried onigiri for a quick, portable meal on the go. Extra onigiri can be wrapped in cling wrap and stored in the fridge for a few days.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
