    <p>
        <em>Appel</em> means apple and <em>paj</em> means pie. Put them together and you have a scrumptious Swedish desert. 
        This pie is so simple, you don't even need to make a crust.  It is delicious warm or cold. For a special treat, top a slice with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Yum!
